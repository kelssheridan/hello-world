<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This project is meant to be viewed as a professional portfolio and a compliation of some of my design work through college.
The website itself is also a demonstration of my technical skill and eye for design.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
I have included a page intoducing myself, a page showcasing a sample of my projects, a page dedicated to my resume and outlining my professional experience and skills, and also a page to contact me and follow me on social media.</p>

<p><i>I hope you enjoy!</i></p>
